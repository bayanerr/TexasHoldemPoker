## Texas Hold'em

PA3 is a construction of an interactive Python game of Texas Hold'em, one of the most popular poker games worldwide. A user who understands its interface should be able to play the game with bots, or they can run test cases through a .txt file with the expected results as a comparison with the program's output. You are able to interact with the program by running it in python. This should display a tkintr window that will tell you what to do.
 

## Build Status

The program fits the specifications provided for the assignment

## Code Style

PA3 uses mostly object-oriented programming (OOP), however, some free-floating functions are used in the program's file mode. Cards, decks, players, and games are all abstracted into their own classes.

## Framework

I used Visual Studio Code and my Macbook's Terminal to edit and test this code, although the modules used are compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems. Python3 is required to run this program.

## Installation

Install my program from [UCI Canvas](https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/)! PA3 uses Python modules *argparse*, *random*, *pathlib*, and *os* in its operations.

## Tests
The user should test this by running it in python and interacting with it. 

## Usage

The Final Project should run through python

There are two aspects of this project

### Gui
Run the gui and interact as a player. Currently in progress and has some bugs that need to be fixed

###Smarter Bots

The bots are made smarter in many ways. First off, they bet different values based on their rank. If their rank is considered high they'll bet a random high amount and changes based on their rank.


## Credit
Thank you to Professor He and TA Brooke for helping me build my coding skills to this point! Brooke specifically helped me learn how to use the *argparse* module effectively.

I frequently utilized the Python Standard Library to better understand some of the commands I was using. This helped me avoid rewriting code that is already free for use in the public domain.

## License
I think my code technically belongs to UCI...
